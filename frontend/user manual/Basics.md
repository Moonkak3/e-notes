### Layout

<img src="image-20211124212913001.png" alt="image-20211124212913001" style="zoom: 50%;" />

The UI is divided into two parts, the navigation drawer and the main content, pretty self explanatory.

You can click on **Open** to open/view a collection

And on **New** to create a new collection
